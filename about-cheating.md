# About cheating

You should not cheat.
Seriously, there are plenty of reasons why you should not cheat.

There are also several reasons why people usually make this choice. Let's first look at that:
- you may find it easier (are you lazy ? no, I can't even think about it)
- you may lack of time
- you may feel unconfortable to see other / friends succeeding while you are still struggling
- you don't want to be stigmatized or seen as a loser by your community, your family, the school, the society
- you possibly are in panic and see it as a life jacket, as it used to be in your past schools / institutions / learning experiences

For us, this is often the symptom of a distress situation. We want to offer through the 42 curriculum a path the give enough confidence to each student so finally no one has to cheat anymore.

The selection process in 42 is wide open to welcome a large diversity in profiles. The Peer-Learning model allows an interesting part of flexibility. This means that everyone is different and will not face the same success or failures. You may struggle on one project or exercises, while your neighbourg or friend will pass it easily. And the opposite a couple of projects later. This happens to everyone, and everyone should be kind and supportive to others in this situation.

The 42 curriculum allows you to try and fail and try again. There is no bonus for speed as long as you keep a regular pace and progression, and a correct commitment (a real min of 25h per week of real active work). So you should not be in a rush to deliver the projects.

The goal of your 42 curriculum is to learn how to learn, to develop your own personal skills (tech and soft). While cheating you are not developping your skills and not learning how to learn. You are just trying to fool other people, and at some point also probably yourself. You are not developing this new state of mind that brings liberty and that makes you free of your choices. So, if you are not developing your skills, what are you doing ? Well, at least you are losing your time (you could use to do something else).

Remember that your are not working for others. You do not get good marks for your parents, for your friends, for the staff, for a teacher (who does not even exists in 42).

**--- But what is cheating ?**

There is a wide range of situations, and if on one side it can be definitely called cheating, on the other side it's way more blurry, and another terminology may be more suitable.
A basic copy/paste of an entire project is just bad. The intention can't be discussed.
But when only a few couple of lines are similar, it's more ambigous. Or if another's project is used as a strong inspiration. And what if an evaluated student is incapable of explaining how some part of code works ? is it still cheating in a way ?

As specialists in education, offering a special pedagogical model, we also know that the brain loves imitating and playing to learn. But imitation does not mean appropriation of other's work ! A fair comparison here is a baby that learn how to walk. First, as you in 42, the baby does not have a lecture about how he should walk ! He sees adults standing up and walking around him. It is clear for him that he wants to do the same, so he starts imitating the adults walking. And he fails. A lot. Without being stigmatised, without being in competition (a baby walks at 12 or 15 months old, and then what ?) and always encouraged by the parents. But the baby can only imitate and replicate what he observes. He cannot copy/paste it and walk instantaneously ! He tested by himself for himself multiple configurations, ideas, to finally find a suitable one for him. Once he knows, he can replicate the movment alone, without any support.
Back to you 42 curriculum. Can you replicate the code you created without any support (human and elements of solution) ? If you can't, it means that at some point you introduced a piece of code that was not yours or that you don't fully understand. And in this situation, your skills are incomplete. You need more work, and that's totally ok. But you have to detect ths situation by yourself: the best way is to erase your work and do it again from scratch. If you have a full understansing of what you did, you will recode it very very quickly. If you are stuck, that's the proof that missed something.

On a more practical point of view, you should not validate a project that clearly is not belonging to the evaluated student (wrong headers, a code you already saw before, neither validate a student that can't explain the code or can't find a key composant of the project).
If you got some doubts about the situation, report to your local pedago staff.

**--- How should we react ?**

We react collectively.
Cheating is bad, specially with a deliberate intention to cheat. All students doing defenses can detect, report, and if not setting the cheat flag, at least choose to not validate the project. You are part of the quality of the school and the network ! And this has an impact on you and your own job and career. Also, the staff from your campus will naturally take actions and sanctions. Remember, we claim out loud that you should not cheat. But we know it's complicated to resist sometimes, so cheating happens. But we are a school, a place were all students learn and an even more special place were students can fail and try again. But for your projects or the cheating, you need to react and make different choices for the next try, or you'll get the same result. And for sure, deliberate cheating, repeating it, will lead you out of 42.
The sooner a cheater face a situation where he is unmasked (with at least one person knows he is a cheater), the sooner he will react and change he behavior. And it always happens at some point: think about your team members, or worse your boss during your internship, when they realize that you are not able to do what you pretend to be able to ?

TL;DR: **You should not cheat.**
