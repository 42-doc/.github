# Peer-Learning

You have heard about Peer-Learning for a while. Visiting your campus website, during the introduction meeting, all over your application process, and if you are already a student, probably multiple times from your staff.

This pedagogical approach defines the way you work and progress inside the 42 curriculum. You should already be familiar with a few elements:
- no lecture, no teacher, no mooc.
- project based, hands-on, and collaborative.

The way you evolve in this learning context is clear:
- register to a new project, including a new problem to solve, with no clue, - no receipe to apply
- gather information that could be related to it
- test, verify, control this information to find out what is true, false, useful, irrelevant, obsolete...
- debate and collaborate with your peers to explain your points of views and ideas, and consider other's. Collectively find new hypothesis to be tested
- try and fail, loop through the previous steps
- complete your project, do the peer evaluations, retry or move to the next project.

But why the peer learning works this way ?

The Peer-Learning finds its origins in the choice to match the situations faced in a company by an ICT employee. The first situation considered was creating a real project for a customer who had a brand new demand or problem. That's initially how came the choice of a project-based curriculum, where students need to find a way to solve a software challenge without any previous lesson.

But quickly, it appeared that being able to look for new informations and knowledge, then use it to solve new problems, was more valuable, not only for companies, but also for students themselves. Indeed, today almost every information is available online. The problem comes from the fact that there is too much data online, and we must learn how to navigate through all of it because we are exposed directly, like every citizen. Even a specialist, or a teacher can't know everything about his own domain of expertise. But he will usually do the filtering for you, based on his own experience, and you will not learn how to face all this information when it's on the contrary very important for you. Same for problem solving: do you want to be able to solve new problems and situations, even being a pioneer ? or a simple employee who executes what he is told to do ? If you need to wait for someone, like again a specialist, a teacher, a book, a recipe, to tell you what to do and how to do it, you will stay as a disposable employee.

That's why the Peer-Learing is designed without any teachers nor referents nor mentors nor any resources. If you want to learn how to learn and develop these adaptation, problem solving, collaboration, creativity, critical thinking (...) skills, it is very important that you doubt of every information you get. I read this blog, my friend tells me that, this tutorial show this... but it is true ? I always need to verify, and do some heavy tests to be sure myself, not relying on someone else's opinion. This is how you will feel confident in the future that you will be able to solve any new upcoming problem. And this will definitely happen, considering the fast pace evolution of ICT.

Today, the 42 pedagogical model can be described as a social constructivist approach. This name comes from very famous specialists in pedagogy from the past century. This means that we consider that the humain brain is not an empty jar to be filled from outside(ex: knowledge transfer by a teacher), but is an individual construct built through practice and social interactions.

The way our peer learning model works has some consequences about what can be done and what should not be done by staff and students. Please read the article dedicated about cheating ;)
