# 42 main goals

If you are in a Piscine or inside the curiculum, what can you expect from 42 ?

Our obvious goal is to train you as an ICT professional, with various technical skills.
But that's not the most important one ;)
We, more that others goals, want you to ***learn how to learn .***

Being an ICT professional can lead you to various profiles: a software developer, a full-stack developer, .... a software engineer, a security specialist, a data scientist... There are plenty of jobs in the labor market.

You may notice that not all of these jobs usually require the same level of training. In the classic higher education paths, it will take from 2 to 5 years after high school to reach such kind of level.
In 42, you have some pace flexibility, and the total duration is individual. Your final level is your choice, as long as you complete the common core. This final level will also define what kind of job and position you can expect in a company.

Why learning how to learn is so important ?
Well, as you know, technologies, coding languages, even brands, are evolving very fast. We can't know today what technical skills you will need during your 40 years long career. So it is very important that you can always adapt to new situations, solve new problems, learn new technologies and new coding languages.
Learning how to learn will give you stability and sustainability in your career. It also can lead you to cutting edge projects so you become a pioneer and be part of the ones who create the future !

But this very important skill does not come easily. It takes time to slowly change your state of mind to free yourself, to become creative, to be able to think out of the box, and finally to have a full mastery of your life.
That's why, completing the common core is so important. It represents the minimal set of tech & soft skills that will open the door to become an entrepreneur, a leader, an expert and so on.
